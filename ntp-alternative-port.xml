    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies an alternative port for the Network Time
        Protocol (NTP) which is restricted in the supported modes and
        extensions to not allow traffic amplification in order to make NTP safe
        for the Internet.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>There are several modes specified for NTP. NTP packets in versions
        2, 3, and 4 have a 3-bit field for the mode. Modes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
        are used for synchronization of clocks. They are specified in <xref
          target="RFC5905">RFC 5905</xref>. Modes 6 and 7 are used for other
        purposes, like monitoring and remote management of NTP servers and
            clients. The mode 6 is specified in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-ntp-mode-6-cmds">Control Messages Protocol for
        Use with Network Time Protocol Version 4</xref>.</t>

      <t>The first group of modes typically does not allow any traffic
        amplification, i.e. the response is not larger than the request. An
        exception is Autokey specified in <xref target="RFC5906">RFC
          5906</xref>. Autokey is rarely supported on public NTP servers.</t>

      <t>However, the modes 6 and 7 allow significant traffic amplification,
        which has been exploited in large-scale denial-of-service (DoS) attacks
        over the Internet.</t>

      <t>Over time, network operators have been observed to implement the
        following mitigations:</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>Blocked UDP packets with destination or source port 123</t>
          <t>Blocked UDP packets with destination or source port 123 and
            specific length (e.g. longer than 48 octets)</t>
          <t>Blocked UDP packets with destination or source port 123 and
            NTP mode 6 or 7</t>
          <t>Limited rate of UDP packets with destination or source port 123</t>
      </list></t>

      <t>From those, only the 3rd approach does not have an impact on
        synchronization of clocks with NTP.</t>

      <t>The number of public servers in the pool.ntp.org project has dropped
        in large part due to the mitigations (citation?).</t>

      <t>Longer NTP packets (using extension fields) are needed by <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-ntp-using-nts-for-ntp">NTS</xref>.</t>

      <t>This document specifies an alternative port for NTP which is
        restricted to the safe modes in order to enable synchronization of
        clocks in networks where the port 123 is blocked or rate limited.</t>

      <section title="Requirements Language">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
          "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
          document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
            target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
      </section>

    <section title="Alternative port">
      <t>The port TBD is an alternative port for NTP. The protocol and the
        format of NTP packets sent from and to this port is unchanged. Both
        NTP requests and responses MAY be sent from the port. An NTP packet
        MUST NOT be sent from the alternative port if it is a response which
        has a longer UDP payload than the request, or the number of NTP packets
        in a single response is larger than one.</t>

      <t>In NTP versions 2, 3, and 4, only modes 1 (active), 2 (passive), 3
        (client), 4 (server), and 5 (broadcast) are generally usable on this
        port.</t>

      <t>An NTP server SHOULD receive requests in the client mode on both the
        original NTP port (123) and the alternative port (TBD). If it responds,
        it MUST send the response from the port which received the request.
        If the server supports any extension fields in NTP packets, it MUST
        verify that each response is not larger than the request, even if the
        number of extension fields is constant and they have a constant
        length.</t>

      <t>When an NTP client is started, it SHOULD send the first request to the
        alternative port. The client SHOULD be switching between the two ports
        until a valid response is received. The client MAY send a limited
        number of requests to both ports at the same time in order to speed up
        the discovery of the responding port. When both ports are responding,
        the client SHOULD prefer the alternative port.</t>

      <t>An NTP server which supports NTS SHOULD include the NTPv4 Port Negotiation
        record in NTS-KE responses to specify the alternative port as the port
        to which the client should send NTP requests.</t>

      <t>In the symmetric modes (active and passive) NTP packets are considered
        to be requests and responses at the same time. Therefore, the peers
        MUST send packets with an equal length in order to synchronize with
        each other. The peers MAY use different polling intervals (packets sent
        at subsequent polls are considered to be separate requests and
        responses).</t>
